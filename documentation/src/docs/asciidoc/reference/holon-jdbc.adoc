== Introduction

The Holon Platform *JDBC* module provides base JDBC support to the Holon platform, dealing with `javax.sql.DataSource` configuration and providing a _multi-tenant_ DataSource implementation. 

Futhermore, the module provides integration with the *Spring* framework relatively to `DataSource` configuration and `DataSource` auto-configuration facilities using *Spring Boot*.

=== Sources and contributions

The Holon Platform *JDBC* module source code is available from the GitHub repository link:https://github.com/holon-platform/holon-jdbc[https://github.com/holon-platform/holon-jdbc^].

See the repository `README` file for information about:

* The source code structure.
* How to build the module artifacts from sources.
* Where to find the code examples.
* How to contribute to the module development.

== Obtaining the artifacts

The Holon Platform uses https://maven.apache.org[Maven^] for projects build and configuration. All the platform artifacts are published in the *Maven Central Repository*, so there is no need to explicitly declare additional repositories in your project `pom` file.

At the top of each _section_ of this documentation you will find the Maven _coordinates_ (group id, artifact id and version) to obtain the artifact(s) as a dependency for your project.

A *BOM (Bill Of Materials)* `pom` is provided to import the available dependencies for a specific version in your projects. The Maven coordinates for the core BOM are the following:

_Maven coordinates_:
[source, xml, subs="attributes+"]
----
<groupId>com.holon-platform.jdbc</groupId>
<artifactId>holon-jdbc-bom</artifactId>
<version>{revnumber}</version>
----

The BOM can be imported in a Maven project in the following way:

[source, xml, subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes+"]
----
<dependencyManagement>
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.holon-platform.jdbc</groupId>
			<artifactId>holon-jdbc-bom</artifactId>
			<version>{revnumber}</version>
			*<type>pom</type>*
			*<scope>import</scope>*
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

=== Using the Platform BOM

The Holon Platform provides an *overall Maven BOM (Bill of Materials)* to easily obtain all the available platform artifacts.

See link:index.html#obtain-the-platform-artifacts[Obtain the platform artifacts] for details.

// Inclusions

include::_datasource.adoc[]

include::_multitenant.adoc[]

include::_spring.adoc[]

== Loggers

By default, the Holon platform uses the https://www.slf4j.org[SLF4J^] API for logging. The use of SLF4J is optional: it is enabled when the presence of SLF4J is detected in the classpath. Otherwise, logging will fall back to JUL (`java.util.logging`).

The logger name for the *JDBC* module is `com.holonplatform.jdbc`.

== System requirements

=== Java

The Holon Platform JDBC module requires https://www.java.com[Java] *8* or higher.
